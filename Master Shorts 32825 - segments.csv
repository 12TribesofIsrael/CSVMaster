13,"to see where these 10 tribes Went IN 721 bc. These are the Lost 1o Tribes of Israel. 2 Esdras:13:39 “And whereas thou sawest that hee gathered another peaceable multitude vnto him; 40 Those are the ten tribes, which were carried away prisoners out of their own land, in the time of Osea the king, whom Salmanasar the king of Assyria ledde away captive, and he carried them over the waters, and so came they into another land.” So the 10 tribes would go to another land during the time of Osea/Hoshea the king. "
19,"one but they were the greatest enemy the Europeans Encountered. Verse 4: “Unstable as water…” They were unstable as water because they moved around so much. In the time of the Spanish Invasion, they were known as a nomadic people, moving from place to place, coast to coast among the islands to the point that they ended up in Florida, Originally being in the mountains of Quito, in South America. Verse 4: “…thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; the defiled thou it: he went up to my couch.” Reuben was not going to excel as far as getting the birthright because he slept with Jacob’s concubine (Genesis 35:22, 1 Chron 5:1). So because of this sin, he did not excel and his birthright was given"
20,"to the sons of Joseph. Further Proof: The following is what happened to Antonio Montezinos (a Spanish explorer), when he visited the Seminole Indians in the mountains of Quito, prior to their migration to Florida. The passage contains what was told to him by the Seminoles, concerning their identity, and the identity of their brothers located in Puerto Rico and Cuba. This information is found in “Lost Tribes and Promised Lands”, by Ronald Sanders on page 363-365. “Upon hearing her words they rose, went over to Montezinos and, to his utter astonishment, said: “Shema, Yisroel, Adonai Elohenu Adonai Ehod” (“Here, O Israel the Lord our God, the Lord is One”). They had recited, in Hebrew, the fundamental credo of Judaism.” “They told him that they were themselves of the tribe of"
21,"Reuben, and that the tribe of Joseph lived on an island nearby.” “Only the sorcerers of his tribe had perceived that they were a special people, and had been warned that they should be left alone. “The God of these children of Israel is the true God,” they had said, “and everything inscribed on their tablets is true. At the end of days, they will be lords of all the nations of the earth. One nation will come bringing many things to this land, and after we have all been provided for, these children of Israel will go forth from where they now are and reign over the whole earth, as they once did.” Simeon and Levi: (Dominicans & Haitians/Scattered regions of the Earth) Genesis 49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren;"
23,"and sold them as slaves. Genesis 49:5 “Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.” All Jacob’s sons are brothers but he describes Simeon & Levi as brothers because in the last days they would live together in one place, The island of Hispaniola. These, Instruments of Cruelty, means they are heavily invoked in witchcraft & the worship of Satan. Levi were priests in the past. They were holy unto the Most high, but now they participate in spiritual Cruelty. Haitians practice Voodoo. Dominicans practice Brujeria. Genesis 49:6 “O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united:” This means, Jacob does not want us to learn the knowledge of their witcraft. When it says their assembly this also"
24,"shows they will be dwelling together in one place: Hispaniola (Dominican republic & Haiti). Then it says Be thou not united because they are brethren, but they are separated & this is why you have the division between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Genesis 49:7 “Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.” The Most High, divided and scattered the tribe of Levi. Mal 2:1 “And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you. “ Mal 2:8 “But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.” The tribe of Levi has strayed"
25,"from the commandments. Because of Slavery they have adopted witchcraft and voodoo. Mal 2:9 “Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.” Now they aren’t teaching their people to keep the Commandments, but are teaching lies they’ve learned under Christianity causing many Levites to fall. There was a curse put on Levi (Haitians), till this day. They are disliked and considered the most impoverished lowest people among all the tribes of Israel. This was punishment for not keeping and teaching God’s commandments, but mixing the belief in the Most High with pagan Idolatry. Judah: (American Negro) The tribe of Judah (American Blacks) along with Benjamin & Levi were sold into captivity by"
26,"the Africans and the Arabs to the Europeans (Psalms 83). The Europeans then transported them in chains on slave ships to America to serve hard bondage as slaves. They came to America on cargo slave ships between the late 1500’s – early 1800’s (Deuteronomy 28:64-68) Genesis 49:1 “And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you [that] which shall befall you in THE LAST DAYS.” Genesis 49:8 “Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.” All the tribes of Israel would praise Judah because of bringing them the truth and the risks they took to bring forth the kingdom, but also because this is the"
28,"of the tribe of Judah – North America. Zach 2:6 “Ho, ho, [come forth], and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD. 7 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest [with] the daughter of Babylon.” Psalms 137:7 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase [it], rase [it, even] to the foundation thereof. 8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy [shall he be], that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.” This shows the Daughter of Babylon is North America, or the United States & that Edom (Europeans) would be the head, the leaders of this place, and the neck of our"
29,"enemies. Zach 12:7 “The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem do not magnify [themselves] against Judah.” The Most High promised that he would save the tents of Judah first by giving them the understanding of the scriptures so they could teach the other tribes and bring them into the true knowledge of Christ; This way all of Israel would acknowledge Judah as the head tribe. Genesis 49:9 “Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?” This shows that Judah is like a fearless lion cub, but is just"
31,"keep us lost, & sleep. “…who shall rouse him up?” Only the Most High can rouse him up. Revelations 11:11 “And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them.” (Also read Ezekiel 37) Three days and an half represent 350 years when the majority of slaves were brought to the Americas in 1620. That brings us to around 1970 when the real truth began to be taught and pushed concerning the American Negroes and Indians being the real Jews. Genesis 49:10 “The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.” This"
32,"is showing how the rulership would not depart from the tribe of Judah and that the King of Kings would come from this very tribe. (Hebrews 7:14) Shiloh is the Peaceable one which is Yashiya/Jesus Christ and it would be him who would gather the 12 tribes of Israel Heb 7:14 “For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.” So the same tribe Christ was from was the very same tribe the American blacks are from. Genesis 49:11 “Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:” The vine is referring to the grape vine (Matthew 21:12, Zech 9:9) “…he washed"
33,"his garments in wine,…” This is speaking about Christ destroying the Edomite nations who went against his people (Isaiah 63:1-3). Genesis 49:12 “His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.” When it says his eyes shall be red with wine, this means Christ would drink so much wine that the iris of his eyes would appear red. (Matthew 11:19) Christ’s appearance: Daniel 10:5 “Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins [were] girded with fine gold of Uphaz:"" Dan 10:6 “His body also [was] like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and the"
34,"voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.” Revelations 1:13 “And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.” Revelations 1:14 “His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;” Revelations 1:15 “And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.” Christ was a black man from the tribe of Judah, just like he’s black, so are his people. Deuteronomy 33:7 “And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring"
35,"him unto his people: let his hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from his enemies.” Judah would have to work and fight for everything he acquires. The American blacks have built this place and invited so many things and yet claimed by the white man. Jer 22:13 “Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;” Jer 11:13 “For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.” This explains that wherever Judah would go, there are"
36,"false set up churches on every other street Worshiping Cesare Borgia & in a multitude of Error. Our people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge Hosea 4:6 & they truly have discontinued from their heritage (Jer 17:4) Zebulun: (Guatemalans down to Panamanians/Mayans) Genesis 49:13 “Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon. “ Zebulon was also part of the 10 Lost Tribes who made their way over into the Americas, or as the bible calls it, the land of Arzareth. In Genesis 49:13 Jacob was telling a future prophecy of what shall come to his son Zebulon in the last days. He did the same with all the other sons of him as"
37,"said in Genesis 49:1-2. “Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for a haven of ships;” A haven of ships and being at the haven of the sea stands for the Panama Canal. The Canal was opened to shipping in 1914. It is a 82 Kilometre ship canal in Panama that connects the Atlantic Ocean & the Pacific Ocean. It is key for international Maritime trade. It decreases the amount of time it takes to bring valuable cargo to America. [Find more information on Panama Canal] Deuteronomy 33:1 “And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.” Deuteronomy 33:18 “And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.”"
38,"This proves Zebulon (Mayans), and Issachar (Aztecs), would live very near each other. The Mayans, would go out of their cities to meet the Aztecs in places of worship within the borders of Mexico; Teotihuacan, at Uxmal, Tocana, Palenque, Chichenitza, Pico de Orizaka, Tres Zapotes & La Ventou, etc. Deuteronomy 33:19 “They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.” The verse represents the time after Moses’ death & in these last days, AD. They made temples and pyramids, as Israelites have been known to do 1 Maccabees 13:28. They eventually strayed from righteous worship & sacrifice too wicked human sacrifice & human organs. Hos 8:13 “They sacrifice"
39,"flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.” This shows the 10 tribes would go back into bondage/slavery. The word Egypt in this passage means Bondage (Exodus 20:2). Hos 8:14 “For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.” Issachar: (Mexicans/Aztecs) Genesis 49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens: Genesis 49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute. Issachar was also part of"
40,"the 10 Tribes to make their way over to the Americas during the Assyrian Captivity. Genesis 49:18 “Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:” When the verse talks about the burdens of the Issacharites, what his father Jacob is referring to is the long hours and Low amount of money the Mexicans are very well known for. For instance, they are some of the hardest working people working 10-15 hours of the day or sometimes from morning to night and yet only getting paid a little amount for their hard work. This has become their burden, receiving little or even no medical benefits and what not. Many jobs are beginning to get moved to Mexico from the US so the wages can be brought down. One of the"
41,"most familiar signs of Mexico is an ass (burro) with two large satchels (Burdens) on either side of the beast. Genesis 49:19 “And he saw that rest was good,” This shows the rest the Mexicans have from their burdens. They are very well known for their rest during working out in long hours. “and the land that it was pleasant;” Mexico, is one of the world’s favorite vacation spots. The land is very fertile and beautiful. Some of the most beautiful beaches and geographical sites reside in Mexico. “and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.” When it says he bowed his shoulder, this shows he would serve. Today, the Mexicans are well known for being hard workers for little to no money, “servant unto tribute”. Deuteronomy"
42,"33:1 “And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.” Deuteronomy 33:18 “And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.” The tribe of Zebulon (Mayans), would go out and meet the tribe of Issachar (Aztecs) in their mountains, at particular seasons and Holy Days. Deuteronomy 33:19 “They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the seas, and of treasures hidden in the sand.” The tribe of Issachar, would blow the Ram’s horn to call Zebulon to the mountains, both in their original land of Israel and in the Americas. Back in Israel, these tribes offered sacrifices according to"
44,"are at the point where they have a holiday celebrating the day of the dead. This was an ancient Babylonian custom (Psalms 106:28) The Mexicans, Aztecs also had great understanding of times, and had superior knowledge of seasons and times. 1Ch 12:32 “And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment.” Dan Genesis 49:16 “Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel”. Genesis 49:17 “Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.” Genesis 49:18 “I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.”"
45,"For the sake of the Length of this Document, I will bring forth the information on Dan in another document; The tribe of Dan is now considered Gentiles because of the Unrighteousness of their forefathers. Gad (North American Indian) Genesis 49:19 “Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.” Genesis 49:19 “Gad, a troop shall overcome him:” The “troop” that overcame the tribe of Gad, was the United State Cavalry. Landing on Plymouth Rock in 1620 is what began this war, which then came to a cease at the battle of Wounded Knee in 1890. Well over 77 Million Indians were killed during this time period of 200 years. They murdered so many North American Indians to establish Church and State. but he shall overcome at"
46,"the end. The tribe of Gad, shall overcome America and all the nations when the savior for his second coming, Yashiya/Jesus Christ. Psa 55:20 “He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.” The Us Calvary came over here and made a covenant with the people and broke it and put hands on the North American Indian. Revelations 2:26 “And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:” Revelations 2:27 “And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.” Deuteronomy 33:1 “And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man"
47,"of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.” Deuteronomy 33:20 “And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad:” The Most High God enlarged the Tribe of Gad with many sons and daughters, despite the genocide the Us cavalry committed against them. There are over 300 so-called Indian nations that make up the tribe of Gad. “he dwelleth as a lion,…”, This shows they dwelt upon the land like lions, fearsome. “and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.”, represent the crown of feathers the Indians wore. The custom of the blood brother pact, was generally done with one who wore the unusual crown of feathers (the War bonnet) to be accepted into the tribe. Deuteronomy 33:21 “And he provided the first part for himself,"
48,"because there, in a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.” The North American Indian took the best part of the land of the Americas. This was the land Christopher Columbus was searching for, and called it the Main Land. The tribe of Gad acted as the lawgivers during the migration to the Americas. Ephraim & Manessah were the heads of the people but Gad executed judgement and Justice among the 10 tribes which moved to the Americas. 1Ch 12:8 “And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield"
49,"and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the rose upon the mountains;” 1Ch 5:18 “The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were four and forty thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the war.” Asher: South Americans (Columbians, Venezuelans, Brazilians/ Inca) Genesis 49:20 “Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.” The tribe of Asher was part of the 10 tribes who came to the Americas. Genesis 49:20 “Out of Asher his bread shall be fat,…” This is talking about the choice of foods and abundance of produce located in"
50,"Brazil, Columbia, Peru and Venezuela. These countries are the world’s biggest producers of cattle, sheep, goat, coffee, castor beans, cocoa, sugar rice, rice, corn, and fruits. “and he shall yield royal dainties.” Dainties refers to foods of a refined taste and exquisite clothing. They bring these forth during their pagan feasts and festivals Deuteronomy 33:24 “And of Asher he said, [Let] Asher [be] blessed with children; let him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in oil.” “[Let] Asher [be] blessed with children.” Asher was blessed with children. Many of the Inca were viciously murdered by the so-called white man (Edomites). The Spanish conquest of Incas was led by two main conquistadores, Francisco Pizarro, and Pedro de Alvarado. They stole their lands, resulting in slaughter and butchers"
51,"of many Inca Indians. They kidnapped the Inca leader Atahuallpa, holding him at ransom. After receiving the payment, they then forced Atahuallpa to convert to Catholicism, and afterward garroted and burned him in the midst of his tribesman. The Spanish, Dutch, French, and Portuguese, were heavily involved in the enslavement of the Incas (Asher). Due to high demands for slaves in the natural resources in the lands, battles were fought over these commodities among these 4 groups. Lamen 5:2 “Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.” The proof of this blessing with the children today is in Brazil, where they have the largest population of children in the world. Due to lack of foster-care, orphanages and welfare, the children are left destitute in the streets without hope Lamen"
52,"5:3 “We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers [are] as widows.” These children resort to prostitution, and robbing tourists to survive. It has gotten so bad that the Brazilian government hires mercenaries from Argentina and Germany, to round up these children and murder them without mercy. Verse 24 Cont. “…and let him dip his foot in oil.” When you examine all the lands that the Incas (Asher ) occupied, from Columbia to Uruguay, they were filled with plenty of oil. Out of all the lands the largest output of crude oil resources in the Americas is found in Columbia. Deuteronomy 33:25 “Thy shoes [shall be] iron and brass; and as thy days, [so shall] thy strength [be].” This means, Asher, would be standing on a lot of mineral resources like, iron,"
53,"brass, chromium, nickel, tin, and copper. NOTE: The Hebrew word for iron is Ba-ra-zal (Brazil) Asher would be a strong tribe. PART 2 12 Tribes breakdown Naphtali (Polynesians; Aborigines of Fiji Islands, Hawaiian Islanders) Genesis 49:21 “Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.” Naphtali was part of the 10 tribes who came over to the Americas during the time of the Assyrian captivity. The name Naphtali means “My wrestling” When it says “Naphtali is a hind let loose” Just like a deer motion via up and down – The Polys travelled through the oceans, from island to island. The motion represents the sea movement. This is also talking about how free and wild the Polynesians are. They are some of the most free people in the world. You"
54,"see this from their dancing, their ceremonies and the way they’re customs are. “…he giveth goodly words.” The people of the Polynesian Islands speak very goodly words, Like Aloha/Hello by the Hawaiians, Kia Kaha/Stand Strong by the Aotearoa, Fa’Amalosi/Be strong by the Samoans. They are known for their Good words and respect. Deuteronomy 33:23 “And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the Lord: possesse thou the West and the South.” “And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and full with the blessing of the Lord:” Their Land is Beautiful and it gives things such as coconuts, Taro and other food of blessing. The tribe of Naphtali was very blessed. When it says “…possesse thou the West and the South”,"
55,"Jacob was telling the exact place where they would dwell in the last days. They would be located in the southern Hemisphere, and that word “West” in the Hebrew is a word Yam means A large body of Water, west (-ward). The tribe of Naphtali would possess land in the Southern Hemisphere surrounded by a large body of water westward. They possess Chili in the South of America, and West of Chili is South Pacific. History shows they were in Chili and are now in the South Pacific. Further Proof: ""The phrase 'Native American' was invented by the U.S. government Department of the Interior in 1970. It is an inventory term used to keep track of people. It includes Hawaiians, Eskimos, Samoans, Micronesians, Polynesians, and Aleuts. Anyone who uses the phrase"
56,"Native American is assisting the U.S. government in its effort to obliterate people's true identities.” ([link]) Native American Y Chromosomes in Polynesia: The Genetic Impact of the Polynesian Slave Trade ([link]) The Melanesians were in slavery (Blackbird). They also worked in the cotton fields in Fiji – The same Europeans were enslaving the black Americans and the Micronesians and Polynesians and they were brought back into South America to work on the Guano Industry In the first half of the 19th century, small-scale slave raids took place across Polynesia to supply labor and sex workers for the whaling and sealing trades, with examples from both the westerly and easterly extremes of the Polynesians triangle. By the 1860s this had grown to a larger scale operation with Peruvian slave raids in the"
57,"South Sea Islands to collect labor for the Guano Industry. A lot of people from Naphtali fled before Columbus arrived in the 1500s but many remained as well and fled into Argentina from Chili – Lima was not a name from Spain, but from the Tribe of Naphtali. I wish I could bring forth more information on Naphtali but still follow up on research. Here is a book and some links for your own edification: Old Samoa by John Williams Joseph - Ephraim/Manessah: (Puerto Ricans & Cubans) Genesis 49:22 “Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall: Genesis 49:23 “The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:” Genesis 49:24 “But his bow abode in strength, and"
58,"the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)” Genesis 49:25 “Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:” Genesis 49:26 “The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.” The name Ephraim, means “I am fruitful”. The name Manasseh means “made to forget” The blessing of Joseph,"
59,"went down to his two sons who were recognized as two of the tribes of Israel. Jacob prophesied that Ephraim would be greater than his brother Manasseh (Genesis 48:13-20). When you see the name “Joseph”, in the scriptures after his death, it is making reference to his two sons, Ephraim first then Manasseh. These two tribes led the migration of the “Tribes of Israel” to the Americas during the Assyrian Captivity. Remember the blessing was upon Ephraim first, then Manassah: Gene 48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid [it] upon Ephraim's head, who [was] the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh [was] the firstborn.15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk,"
60,"the God which fed me all my life long unto this day,16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this [is] the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.19 And his father refused, and said, I know [it], my son, I know [it]: he also shall become a people, and"
61,"he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh. During the Middle Ages, the native Indians of Puerto Rico, Called themselves Boriqua, a Hebrew word for Brave. They called their island Borinquen a Hebrew word for “Land of the Brave Lords” and some translations say “many/abundant”. A Hebrew word? Yes, a Hebrew word, little do you know that the language spoken on the island of Boriquan, prior to the invasion of the Spaniards, was Hebrew. This fact will be proven later on in this segment. Where did these so-called"
63,"various trade routes to exchange and sell different materials. If they could not communicate with each other, these routes would not have existed. For example the Seminole Indians and the Boriqua Indians, had close relations in trading and visited each other frequently. Even Ponce de Leon, learned of these relations in his search for the mythical “fountain of youth”; the boriqua Indians, sent him to the Seminoles in Florida. Now, let’s prove that Ephraim ended up in Puerto Rico and Manasseh in Cuba. The following is what happened to Montezinos (a Spanish Explorer), when he visited the Seminole Indians, in the mountains of Quito, prior to their migration to Florida. This passage contains what was told to him by the natives concerning their identity and the identity of their brothers located"
64,"in Puerto Rico and Cuba. This information is found in “Lost Tribes and Promised Lands” by Ronald Sanders on pages 363-365. “Upon hearing her words they rose, went over to Montezinos and, to his utter astonishment, said: “Shema, Yisroel, Adonai Elohenu Adonai Ehod” (“Here, O Israel the Lord our God, the Lord is One”). They had recited, in Hebrew, the fundamental credo of Judaism.” “They told him that they were themselves of the tribe of Reuben, and that the tribe of Joseph lived on an island nearby.” The blessing of Joseph went down to his two sons Ephraim and Manesseh. A “bough” is a tree, so when the scripture says; “even a fruitful bough by a well” it is showing us a comparison of how a tree that is planted near"
65,"water is fruitful the same way the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, would be located near water (island) and be very fruitful. Cuba means “fruitful” and just like the name says the So-called Puerto Ricans, are fruitful and just like the name says the So-called Puerto Ricans, are fruitful by having many children and very large families as well. “Whose branches run over the wall…” the same way branches go over a wall that divides them from the other trees and branches, to mix with them, is the same way the daughters of Ephraim, went over the wall of racial division to mix with the Spanish, by marrying the Spaniards. The Spanish built a fort in Puerto Rico, encompassed by what’s called “el morro” meaning “the wall” which was meant to keep other invading whites from stealing Boriqua slaves and taking Puerto Rico."
67,"says Ephraim is a cake not turned means that the same way a pancake is not turned when bakes, one side would be dark and the other side light, is similar to the complexion of the so called Puerto Ricans, which range from dark brown to a very light skinned some even appear Caucasian. But, only those whose fathers are of Boiquan descent are Israelites. Genesis 49:23 “The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him.” The “archers” are talking about the conquistadors of Spain. They sorely grieved Ephraim, by having the Boriqua Indians work in gold mines and sugar cane fields under very hard and strenuous conditions. When Columbus came in 1493, he subdued Ephraim with great slaughter. Also when Ponce de Leon came in 1508,"
68,"he had 6,000 Boriqua Indians shot because they protested slave working conditions. Out of 40, 000 Boriqua Indians, only 4000 remained on the island of Puerto Rico, during this invasion. The Spaniards enslaved Ephraim and sent thousands of them to serve slavery in Spain, and Hawaii on slave ships ( Deuteronomy 28:68) and stripped Puerto Rico of its wealth and Riches. Genesis 49:2 “But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong, by the hands of the mighty God of Iacob: from thence is the Shepherd, the stone of Israel,” Joseph’s bow abode in strength because he kept the commandments. His hands were made strong when the Most High, honored Joseph by making him second over all Egypt. Genesis 49:25 “Euen by the God of"
69,"thy father who shall help thee, and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deepe that lyeth vnder, blessings of the breasts and of the womb.” Ephraim would have good weather on the island of Puerto Rico. Their island would be around seas and riches. Also, the various exotic fish in the deep ocean. When it says, “… blessings of the breasts and the womb.”, This is talking about Ephraim, being fruitful with many children which is a beautiful blessing. So although many Boriqua Indians were killed, Ephraim’s fruitfulness kept the tribes in existence because of the Most High’s blessings. Genesis 49:26 “The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors: vnto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills,"
70,"they shall bee on the head of Ioseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.” Jacob is letting Ephraim know that his father’s blessings were greater than the blessings of Abraham and Isaac while they lived, because Joseph was extremely famous and was second under Pharaoh in Egypt and owed a vast amount of lands within Egypt. Joseph, being in this position was able to support his father and the rest of his brethren and their children. Deuteronomy 33:13 “And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD [be] his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,” Deuteronomy 33:14 “And for the precious fruits [brought forth] by the sun, and for the precious"
71,"things put forth by the moon,” The Precious fruits are things like mangos, papayas, avocados, pineapples, coconuts, bananas and sugarcane, which are fruits the island is well known for. The precious things brought forth by the moon, for example, is the “coqui” which is a small frog that can only live in Puerto Rico. It only comes out at night and makes a very distinctive whistle throughout the night. Deuteronomy Deuteronomy 33:15 “And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the precious things of the lasting hills,” This verse is talking about the great amount of diamonds, gold, and silver found in the mountains of Borinquen; which was the primary source of slave labor that the Boriqua Indians were made to serve. The “precious things of the lasting"
72,"hills”, is talking about the coffee beans found in the hills of the island. Deuteronomy 33: 16 “And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof, and [for] the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let [the blessing] come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him [that was] separated from his brethren.” This is talking about the blessings that Joseph got when he was sold by his brothers and ended up in Egypt. Deuteronomy 33:17 “His glory [is like] the firstling of his bullock, and his horns [are like] the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth: and they [are] the ten thousands of Ephraim, and they [are] the"
73,"thousands of Manasseh.” This means all the firstborn males are chosen by the most high to be his, his horns refers to the leaders of Ephraim and Manesseh. The lost used the leaders of Ephraim and Manesseh to push/ guide the 10 tribes of Israel to the ends of the earth meaning the other side of the world – Arsareth / the Americas. Read 2 Esdras 13:40-45 Hosea 11:10”They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.” Hosea 4:17 “Ephraim [is] joined to idols: let him alone.” The bible prophesied how the so-called Puerto Rican & Cubans (Ephraim & Manasseh) would have many idols. The false whi9te images of Christ (Cesare Borgia), Mary and Lazarus are"
74,"the main idols that they are joined to. They worship these idols by putting tattoos of these images on their bodies, putting statues on the dashboard of their cars and wearing gold chains with these false images as pendants. Also in their homes they make altars with the pictures of these images in the center with different color candles around it. “Let him alone” means when you show a Puerto Rican that Christ is a black –man and they don’t want to accept it just leave him alone. Hosea 8: 11 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin. 12 I have written to him the great things of my law, [but] they were counted as a strange thing. When they make these altars"
76,"shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.” Genesis 49:28 “All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spoke unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.” The tribe of Benjamin, along with Judah and Levi, were sold into captivity(by the Africans and Arabs) to the White-man. The white man then transported them in chains on slave ships to Jamaica, and various West Indian islands to serve hard bondage as slaves. During slavery we had the Maroons, the word maroon is latin meaning wolf, primarily throughout the West Indies, which were runaway slaves that fled to the mountains and swamps of the islands. The white"
77,"man could not subdue these men because they knew the land very well and could survive on their own; living off the land. They firmly believed in liberty or death, in other words, if they could not be free they would rather be dead. Genesis 49:27 “Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf:” The word “Ravin”, in this sense means speak boldly/harshly. The tribe of Benjamin, ravin as wolves through their music by speaking the truth that they are Israelites and God will judge Babylon (America and all who went against God’s people) for the injustice they have done to the children of Israel (slavery, raping our women, dividing the families etc.) For example, in Jamaica, and the other Caribbean islands, the white man buys up the best parts of the land,"
78,"and has the people work the land for almost nothing (slave labor). The tribe of Benjamin, “Ravin” about their suffering and oppression, by singing about it in their music; songs contrary to what was forced upon them by the white man through his religions, that Christ and the Israelites are white etc. Certain artists speak through their music of America being Babylon (psalms 137 proves America is Babylon) and how it's going to fall (Revelation 18:19-21); that Christ, Solomon etc are black according to the bible, and also sing about themselves being Israelites. Most reggae artists get their inspiration from the bible; from books like psalms and revelation. When the scripture says, “…As a wolf” meaning the same way a wolf howls at its prey before attacking it; is the same"
79,"way the tribe of Benjamin are howling at the white race through their music. Genesis 49:27 continues, “… in the morning he shall devour the prey,” the morning represents the tribe of Benjamin, being raised up in rulership in the Kingdom of Heaven Isaiah 9:2 “The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.” Verse 27 continues, “…and at night he shall divide the spoil”, the night represents the end of the white man’s rulership (1 Esdras 6:9), with the second coming of Christ; read Zephaniah 1:14-15. It will be the white man’s night (captivity) and our day (rulership over all nations). Benjamin and the other tribes will divide the riches and"
80,"wealth of the nations, read Jeremiah 30:16. Deuteronomy 33:12 “[And] of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; [and the LORD] shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders”. This is talking about the Most High, protecting Benjamin, from his enemies and that the white man during slavery did not kill them off. In the end, the tribe of Benjamin shall Devour the prey”, which is the white man and other nations for enslaving them. Where it says he shall cover them, this means he would bless Benjamin, with good weather and land etc. So the 12 Tribes of Israel, the True Hebrew Israelites of the Bible are: Reuben - So called Seminole Indians / Aboriginal Australians Simeon"
81,"- So called Dominicans Levi - So called Haitians Judah - So called African Americans / Negroes Zebulon - Guatemalans / Panamanians Issachar - So called Mexicans Gad - So called North American Indians Asher - Columbians/ Brazilians / Argentines / Venezuelans Naphtali - Hawaiians / Samoans / Tongans / Fijians Ephraim - So called Puerto Ricans Manasseh - So called Cubans Benjamin - So called Jamaicans / Trinidadians / Guyanese Why does it matter? Paul asked the same question, why does it matter to know we are the people, Gods chosen? Rom 3:1 “What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of Circumcision?” Rom 3:2 “Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the Oracles of God.” Paul asked himself, what advantage is it that"
83,"the bible says with doctrines such as the Immaculate conception, Rapture, Trinity, Idol worship, and pagan practices along with Philosophy. It is now our job in these last days to humble ourselves and come back to Christ and the father, and preach the truth and be leaders in these last days, as Revelations prophecies we’ll do. Revelations 7:1 And after these things, I saw four Angels standing on the four corners of the Earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree. Revelations 7:2 And I saw another Angel ascending from the East, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four Angels to whom it was"
